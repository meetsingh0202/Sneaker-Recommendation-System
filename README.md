# Sneaker-Recommendation-System

This project entails the creation of a sophisticated shoe recommendation system, aimed at delivering tailored suggestions to users. The system employs a hybrid methodology that seamlessly merges collaborative filtering and content-based strategies. By combining these two powerful techniques, the system can provide more accurate and diverse recommendations, enhancing user satisfaction.

To engage with the system, users have the opportunity to log in, allowing them to access a personalized experience. Through this, users can receive shoe recommendations that align with their unique preferences, style, and requirements. This personalized approach not only enhances the user experience but also fosters increased engagement and customer loyalty.

This project is particularly significant as it has been developed with the intent to participate in the prestigious Flipkart Grid 5.0 competition.
